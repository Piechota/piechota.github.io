index_raw.html and resum_raw.css -> those are modified by hand.
resume_formatting.py -> formats index_raw.html and outputs index.html (the same for css)
resume_media_resize.py -> iterates over dir media and resize them to small versions.

workflow:
-add media
-run python3 resume_media_resize.py
 there is param '-f' that let you specify formats. Formats can be passed with/without . but need to be separated with ,
-edit index_raw.html/resum_raw.css
-run python3 resume_formatting.py

Notes:
there is some bug with mp4 downsampling. BT car video has long pause after finishing.
